# Shakespeare_Bot 

A character-level text generation model trained on Shakespeare’s plays using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). This bot generates text in Shakespearean style and includes a simple user interface for interactive prompts.

This project was built as part of a coding exploration into AI and creativity. The goal was to train a model that could generate Shakespearean-style text and allow users to interact with it via a prompt loop.

## Features
- RNN with LSTM architecture trained on Shakespeare’s plays
- Character-level text generation
- User input loop for multiple prompts
- Checkpoint saving and loading

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Spyder or Jupyter Notebook (recommended for running locally)
